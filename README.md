## Cross-Iteration BatchNormalization
this repository contains the tensorflow-1.x implementation of the recent Cross-Iteration BatchNormalization method. Please visit [Cross-iterationBatchNorm]( https://github.com/Howal/Cross-iterationBatchNorm) if you're interested about the original PyTorch Version. Or you can read [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05712) for more details.

## Problem Recording
I was wondering that why this implementation always has a lower performance compared to the original BN. Is it because the dataset I use is too small or what I did wrong? If you know this please please tell me.
